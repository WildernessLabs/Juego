To compile the develop branch you will need:

Meadow.Core
Meadow.Units
Meadow.Contracts
Meadow.Foundation
Meadow.Logging

All repos available here: https://github.com/wildernesslabs/

You will need to clone all repos including Juego at the same folder level and set all repos to the develop branch.

Also, make sure you are running the latest version of Meadow OS on your Jeugo v2 board.

To validate Juego, connect your Juego, and deplot the Juego_Demo application.

** Note 

The Juego and JuegoTester projects are legacy and will be either removed or substantially re-written in the near future.
